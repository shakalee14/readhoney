A Community Bookstore Application by Monica &amp; Shaka

## Description

Create a simple content management system that allows users to add, delete, or update books.  Books entered in the system can be viewed in a listing, or searched for using basic searches (title, author, genre). 

## Context

Creating this web application will provide exposure to:
* Express (or other web framework)
* Javascript
* Simple relational database interactions (Create, Read, Update, Delete), with SQL practice
* Simple server side templating (to render data retrieved from the database)

## User Stories

- JJ as a user can sign up for RH, be directed to the landing page
- JJ as a user can see the most recent books as "have" or "wanted" by fellow users
- JJ can click to a tab to see specific books they are looking for and use a search to filter results
- JJ can add a book to the community book listing database that they either want or have
- JJ can find contact information for other users
